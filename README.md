# oNtHEmAP
oNtHEmAP is an iOS app with a map that shows information posted by other students. The map will contain pins that show the location where other students have reported studying. By tapping on the pin users can see a URL for something the student finds interesting. The user will be able to add their own data by posting a string that can be reverse geocoded to a location, and a URL.

## Udacity Project 
**oNtHEmAP** is part of my learning at Udacity. I learn about Network Requests and GCD for creating this app. Incorporate networking into apps, and harness the power of APIs to display images and retrieve data. Use Appleâ€™s Grand Central Dispatch, or GCD, framework to create asynchronous apps, ensuring a smooth user experience, even while my apps run lengthy operations in the background.

### Become an iOS Developer at Udacity
[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003) is nanodegree programs. Become an iOS Develper is an course I enrolled. It helps me master the Swift programing language and vreate a portfolio of iOS apps.
